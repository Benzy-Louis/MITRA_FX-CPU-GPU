This dissertation describes the development, and testing of software and general purpose computing hardware as part of the integration of Digital Systems for the Multi-frequency Interferometry for Astronomy (MITRA) array. High performance software correlation was implemented with the DiFX (Distributed FX) software by Adam Deller, making it an off the shelf, user-friendly and custom documented software further possibilities offered by General-purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) were implemented, developed, and tested taking advantage of its advance parallelism, and performance with typical speedups of $\ldots$ compared to $\ldots$ with the DiFX software $\ldots$
