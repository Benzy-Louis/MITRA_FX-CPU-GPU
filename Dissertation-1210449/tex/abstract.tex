This dissertation describes the development, and testing of software and general purpose computing hardware for the integration of Digital Systems in the Multi-frequency Interferometry for Astronomy (MITRA) array. High performance software correlation was implemented with the DiFX (Distributed FX) software by~\citet{AdamDiFX2007}, making it an off the shelf, user-friendly, and custom documented software. Further possibilities offered by General-purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) were implemented, developed, and tested taking advantage of its advance parallelism, and performance, with typical speedups of $\ldots$ observed compared to $\ldots$ with the DiFX software $\ldots$
