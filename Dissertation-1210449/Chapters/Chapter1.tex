\section{Aims and objectives}
\label{sec:aboutAimObjectives}
This project is aimed at the development, and testing of software and general purpose computing hardware for the Multi-frequency Interferometry for Astronomy (MITRA) array project. In so doing it will pave the way for a higher integration of digital systems as opposed to specialised hardware in the synthesis imaging process. The particular application which was focused on was that of high performance software correlation by the use of parallel computing. The central objective was to implement the DiFX (Distributed FX) software by Adam Deller for the MITRA by making it an off the shelf, user-friendly and custom documented software. The second part of the project was to explore the further possibilities opened up by General-purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) to implement, develop, and test code taking advantage of its advance parallelism, and performance. I hope that the that the work on this particular project will not stay still and that this dissertation will inspire other people to continue to the work, thus from that initiative follows naturally the creation a public git repository:~\url{https://github.com/Benzy-Louis/MITRA_FX-CPU-GPU.git} where those interested to contribute to the project can continue the development, work on the source code, and improve the software and its documentation on their own or contribute for the same to the repository, those interested are freely encouraged to mail me at~\href{mailto:louis.ruben@gmail.com}{louis.ruben@gmail.com} if they want to contribute or have questions, suggestions on the project or on this dissertation and an appendix is written for the purpose of the use of the git repository $\ldots$
