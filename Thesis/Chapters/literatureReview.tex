{\large Jheengut - Software Correlation}\\
\indent
\textit{Software correlation is seen to replace digital correlation as a step forward in removing the excessive cost for dedicated hardware in the near future. A software correlator for radio astronomy has been designed in the {\textsc{Fortran}} programming language with design considerations as an off the shelf project. The flexibility of a software correlation is being taken as an aid to solve problems found in dedicated hardware to be upgraded and maintained properly.

\indent
\textit{The MWA is a next-generation radio interferometer under construction
in remote Western Australia. The data rate from the correlator makes
storing the raw data infeasible, so the data must be processed in real-time. The
processing task is of order 10 TFLOPs$^{-1}$. The remote location of the MWA
limits the power that can be allocated to computing. We describe the design and
implementation of elements of the MWA real-time data processing system which
leverage the computing abilities of modern graphics processing units (GPUs).
The matrix algebra and texture mapping capabilities of GPUs are well suited to
the majority of tasks involved in real-time calibration and imaging. Considerable
performance advantages over a conventional CPU-based reference implementation
are obtained.}

\indent
\textit{
The increasing array size of radio astronomy interferometers is causing the associated computation to scale quadratically with the number of array signals. Consequently, efficient usage of alternate processing architectures should be explored in order to meet this computational challenge. Affordable parallel processors have been made available to the general scientific community in the form of the commodity graphics card. This work investigates the use of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in the parallelisation of the combined conjugate multiply and accumulation stage of a correlator for a radio astronomy array. Using NVIDIA’s Compute Unified Device Architecture, our testing shows processing speeds from one to two orders of magnitude faster than a Central Processing
Unit (CPU) approach.

Correlator using FPGA co-processors }

\textit{This article presents and characterises our work on
accelerating a software radio astronomy correlator
using reconfigurable computing (RC) hardware. Radio
astronomy correlation is an embarrassingly parallel signal
processing application, which is used heavily in
radio astronomy for imaging and other astronomical
measurements. Radio astronomy correlators typically
operate on huge data sets and often require real-time
processing, as storage of raw data is impractical - resulting
in substantial computational requirement. Currently
FPGAs are the preferred processing architecture used in
modern large radio astronomy correlators [1] and perform
well on the types of DSP functions that correlators
perform.
In this paper we set out to accelerate the DiFX
(Distributed FX) correlator, a software correlator, using
FPGA reconfigurable computing hardware. —– hoping
to inherit some of the advantages that larger production
FPGA correlators have over software.}\\

Radio Astronomy Signals }

\textit{A recent development in radio astronomy is to replace traditional
dishes with many small antennas. The signals are combined to form
one large, virtual telescope. The enormous data streams are crosscorrelated
to filter out noise. This is especially challenging, since
the computational demands grow quadratically with the number of
data streams. Moreover, the correlator is not only computationally
intensive, but also very I/O intensive. The LOFAR telescope, for
instance, will produce over 100 terabytes per day. The future SKA
telescope will even require in the order of exaflops, and petabits/s
of I/O. A recent trend is to correlate in software instead of dedicated
hardware. This is done to increase flexibility and to reduce
development efforts. Examples include e-VLBI and LOFAR.
In this paper, we evaluate the correlator algorithm on multi-core
CPUs and many-core architectures, such as NVIDIAand ATIGPUs,
and the Cell/B.E. The correlator is a streaming, real-time application,
and is much more I/O intensive than applications that are
typically implemented on many-core hardware today. We compare
with the LOFAR production correlator on an IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer.
We investigate performance, power efficiency, and
programmability. We identify several important architectural problems
which cause architectures to perform suboptimally. Our findings
are applicable to data-intensive applications in general.
The results show that the processing power and memory bandwidth
of current GPUs are highly imbalanced for correlation purposes.
While the production correlator on the Blue Gene/P achieves a superb 96\% of the theoretical peak performance, this is only 14\%
on ATI GPUs, and 26\% on NVIDIA GPUs. The Cell/B.E. processor,
in contrast, achieves an excellent 92\%. We found that the
Cell/B.E. is also the most energy-efficient solution, it runs the correlator
5-7 times more energy efficiently than the Blue Gene/P. The
research presented is an important pathfinder for next-generation
telescopes.

{\large Andrew Woods,
Michael Inggs and Alan Langman - \hfill \\ Accelerating a Software Radio Astronomy
Correlator using FPGA co-processors }\\
\indent \textit{This thesis attempts to accelerate compute intensive sections of a frequency domain radio
astronomy correlator using dedicated co-processors. Two co-processor implementations were
made independently with one using reconfigurable hardware (Xilinx Virtex 4LX100) and the
other uses a graphics processor (Nvidia 9800GT). The objective of a radio astronomy correlator
is to compute the complex valued correlation products for each baseline which can be used
to reconstruct the sky’s radio brightness distribution. Radio astronomy correlators have huge
computation demands and this dissertation focuses on the computational aspects of correlation,
concentrating on the X-engine stage of the correlator.
Although correlation is an extremely compute intensive process, it does not necessarily require
custom hardware. This is especially true for older correlators or VLBI experiments, where
the processing and I/O requirements can be satisfied by commodity processors in software.
Discrete software co-processors like GPUs and FPGAs are an attractive option to accelerate
software correlation, potentially offering better FLOPS/watt and FLOPS/\$ performance.
In this dissertation we describe the acceleration of the X-engine stage of a correlator on a
CUDA GPU and an FPGA. We compare the co-processors’ performance with a CPU software
correlator implementation in a range of different benchmarks. Speedups of 7x and 12.5x were
achieved on the FPGA and GPU correlator implementations respectively.
Although both implementations achieved speedups and better power utilisation than the CPU
implementation, the GPU implementation produced better performance in a shorter development
time than the FPGA. The FPGA implementation was hampered by the development
tools and the slow PCI-X bus, which is used to communicate with the host. Additionally, the
Virtex 4 LX100 FPGA was released two years before the Nvidia G80 GPU and so is more behind
the current technologies. However, the FPGA does have an advantage in terms of power
efficiency, but power consumption is only a concern for large compute clusters. We found that
using GPUs was the better option to accelerate small-scale software X-engine correlation than
the Virtex 4 FPGA.

\indent \textit{Caused by historical separation and driven by the requirements of the PC gaming 
industry, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have evolved to massive parallel processing 
systems which entered the area of non-graphic related applications. Although a single 
processing core on the GPU is much slower and provides less functionality than its 
counterpart on the CPU, the huge number of these small processing entities outperforms 
the classical processors when the application can be parallelized. Thus, in  
recent years various radio astronomical projects have started to make use of this 
technology either to realize the correlator on this platform or to establish the 
post-processing pipeline with GPUs. Therefore, the feasibility of GPUs as a choice 
for a VLBI correlator is being investigated, including pros and cons of this technology. 
Additionally, a GPU based software correlator will be reviewed with respect to 
energy consumption/GFlop/sec and cost/GFlop/sec.

 \indent \textit{Modern computer architectures suited for general purpose computing are often not the best choice for either I/O-bound or compute-bound problems. Sometimes the best choice is not to choose a single architecture, but to take advantage of the best characteristics of different computer architectures to solve your problems. This paper examines the tradeoffs between using computer systems based on the ubiquitous X86 Central Processing Units (CPU's), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based signal processors, and Graphical Processing Units (GPU's). We will show how a heterogeneous system can be produced that blends the best of each of these technologies into a real-time signal processing system. FPGA's tightly coupled to analog-to-digital converters connect the instrument to the telescope and supply the first level of computing to the system. These FPGA's are coupled to other FPGA's to continue to provide highly efficient processing power. Data is then packaged up and shipped over fast networks to a cluster of general purpose computers equipped with GPU's, which are used for floating-point intensive computation. Finally, the data is handled by the CPU and written to disk, or further processed. Each of the elements in the system has been chosen for its specific characteristics and the role it can play in creating a system that does the most for the least, in terms of power, space, and money.

\indent \textit{The first part of the project consisted of designing and building a front-end and back-end system for radioastronomy. Eight Log-periodic dipole antennas (available at the MRT) were used for the front-end.
In the second part, a new data acquisition card was used. This card was studied and programmed before used. The card was tested several times in order to check whether the analog data were digitised. Next, the whole system was tested and observations were carried out. Celestial objects like Virgo A and Centaurus A were successfully observed.

\indent \textit{The LOFAR radio telescope consists of tens of thousands of dipole antennas that combine
their signals to operate as a single large radio telescope. The truly innovative aspect of
this new telescope is that its pointing system is not mechanical. It is steered by combining
the electric signals from different elements using advanced beam-forming software. Imaging
software is one of the important aspects of processing the high-volume data streams
produced by LOFAR, and is one of the best places to use GPUs to achieve processing
speed. We were able to achieve up to 30 times performance gain compared to the CPU
implementation in novel, computationally intensive techniques such as the Minimum Variance
Distortionless Response (MVDR). We have gained 5-6 times speed-up compared to
the CPU implementation for standard imaging algorithms.

{\large M. A. Clark, P. C. La Plante, L. J. Greenhill - \hfill \\ Accelerating Radio Astronomy Cross-Correlation with Graphics Processing Units }\\
\indent \textit{We present a highly parallel implementation of the cross-correlation of time-series data using graphics processing units (GPUs), which is scalable to hundreds of independent inputs and suitable for the processing of signals from "Large-N" arrays of many radio antennas. The computational part of the algorithm, the X-engine, is implementated efficiently on Nvidia's Fermi architecture, sustaining up to 79\% of the peak single precision floating-point throughput. We compare performance obtained for hardware- and software-managed caches, observing significantly better performance for the latter. The high performance reported involves use of a multi-level data tiling strategy in memory and use of a pipelined algorithm with simultaneous computation and transfer of data from host to device memory. The speed of code development, flexibility, and low cost of the GPU implementations compared to ASIC and FPGA implementations have the potential to greatly shorten the cycle of correlator development and deployment, for cases where some power consumption penalty can be tolerated.

\indent \textit{This paper presents a novel work-distribution strategy for GPUs, that effciently convolves radio-telescope data onto a grid, one of the most time-consuming processing steps to
create a sky image. Unlike existing work-distribution strategies, this strategy keeps the number of device-memory accesses low, without incurring the overhead from sorting or searching within telescope data. Performance measurements show that the strategy is an order of magnitude faster than
existing accelerator-based gridders. We compare CUDA and OpenCL performance for multiple platforms. Also, we report very good multi-GPU scaling properties on a system with eight GPUs, and show that our prototype implementation is highly energy effcient. Finally, we describe how a unique property of GPUs, fast texture interpolation, can be used as a potential way to improve image quality.

\indent \textit{Traditional radio telescopes use large steel dishes
to observe radio sources. The largest radio telescope in
the world, LOFAR, uses tens of thousands of fixed, omnidirectional
antennas instead, a novel design that promises
ground-breaking research in astronomy. Where traditional telescopes
use custom-built hardware, LOFAR uses software to do
signal processing in real time. This leads to an instrument that
is inherently more flexible. However, the enormous data rates
and processing requirements (tens to hundreds of teraflops)
make this extremely challenging. The next-generation telescope,
the SKA, will require exaflops. Unlike traditional instruments,
LOFAR and SKA can observe in hundreds of directions
simultaneously, using beam forming. This is useful, for example,
to search the sky for pulsars (i.e. rapidly rotating highly
magnetized neutron stars). Beam forming is an important
technique in signal processing: it is also used in WIFI and 4G
cellular networks, radar systems, and health-care microwave
imaging instruments.
We propose the use of many-core architectures, such as 48-
core CPU systems and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), to
accelerate beam forming. We use two different frameworks for
GPUs, CUDA and OpenCL, and present results for hardware
from different vendors (i.e. AMD and NVIDIA). Additionally,
we implement the LOFAR beam former on multi-core CPUs,
using OpenMP with SSE vector instructions. We use autotuning
to support different architectures and implementation
frameworks, achieving both platform and performance portability.
Finally, we compare our results with the production
implementation, written in assembly and running on an IBM
Blue Gene/P supercomputer. We compare both computational
and power efficiency, since power usage is one of the fundamental
challenges modern radio telescopes face. Compared to
the production implementation, our auto-tuned beam former
is 45–50 times faster on GPUs, and 2–8 times more power
efficient. Our experimental results lead to the conclusion that
GPUs are an attractive solution to accelerate beam forming.
