\section*{Question 3}
Write a bash script that prompts the user to enter the height of an object dropped from rest (neglecting air resistance). The program should then print out the object's time to fall to the ground and velocity at impact in several different units including

\begin{itemize}
\item meters/sec 
\item ft/sec 
\item miles per hour 

Here is an example run of the program (user input in bold):
